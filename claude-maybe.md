- when debugging:
    - don't assume the first reason you think of for the bug is necessarily the correct one or only correct one
    - remember you can also use web research 
    - do not treat the current code as gospel, the code may be making incorrect assumptions etc, especially code related to a bug being discussed
    - if the code is complex and potentially hard to understand, you can take debugging sessions as an opportunity to do incremental refactoring
    
    
- make sure code is super readable and simple, and obvious in what it is doing, use small functions for organization when needed, make a clear execution path and separate concerns where appropriate
